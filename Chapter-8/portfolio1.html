        Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the founding father of Pakistan and
        a key leader in the struggle for independence from British rule. Born on
        December 25, 1876, in Karachi, he initially worked as a lawyer and
        became a prominent political leader in the Indian National Congress
        before joining the All India Muslim League. Jinnah advocated for the
        rights of Muslims in India and led the demand for a separate nation,
        achieving the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Known for his
        integrity, vision, and dedication, he remains a respected figure in
        Pakistan'sÂ history.
